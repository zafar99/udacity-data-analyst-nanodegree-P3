\section{Problems Encountered in the Map}

After downloading the Map Zen dataset for Lexington, Kentucky, I audited
the data using some techniques from Problem Set 6. The following data
inconsistencies were noticed:
\begin{itemize}
\item Abbreviated street names
\item Inconsistent capitalization
\item Data entry problems with ZIP codes
\item Data entry problems with street name
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Abbreviated Street Names}

Using the regular expression to detect the street type, I audited
the street names to find abbreviated or irregular street types. I
used the \texttt{expected} array of street types from Problem Set
6, and then updated it with more street types that are present in
the Lexington area. I cross-referenced strange street names like ``Esplanade''
and ``Headley Green'' with Google Maps. A subsequent run returned
the following problems:

\begin{lstlisting}
{'120': set(['Versailles Road #120']),
 '168': set(['West Lowry Lane #168']),
 '600': set(['East Vine Street, Suite 600']),
 'Ave': set(['524 Angliana Ave']),
 'Ave.': set(['E. Euclid Ave.']),
 'Blvd': set(["Man o' War Blvd", 'Polo Club Blvd']),
 'Blvd.': set(['Martin Luther King Blvd.']),
 'Courth': set(['Deltino Courth']),
 'Ct': set(['Belfair Ct']),
 'DR': set(['NEEDLERUSH DR']),
 'Dr': set(['Beaumont Circle Dr', 'Nichols Park Dr', 'Parkway Dr']),
 'Dr.': set(['Southland Dr.', 'Tates Creek Centre Dr.', 'Walden Dr.']),
 'Ln': set(['Norman Ln', 'W Lowry Ln', 'W. Lowry Ln']),
 'NE': set(['New Circle Road NE']),
 'Rd': set(['E New Circle Rd', 'East Reynolds Rd', ...]),
 'Rd.': set(['Redding Rd.', 'Tates Creek Rd.', 'W. New Circle Rd.']),
 'St': set(['E Main St', 'E. Main St', 'Jefferson St']),
 'St.': set(['N. Limestone St.', 'S Limestone St.']),
 'Ter': set(['Columbia Ter']),
 'broadway': set(['North broadway']),
 'drive': set(['cooper drive'])}
\end{lstlisting}


The apartment/suite numbers are fine and will be fixed. One spelling
error was found: ``Courth'' should be ``Court.'' The abbreviations,
including the cardinal direction abbreviations, will be replaced with
their full word equivalents.


\subsection{Inconsistent Capitalization}

From the above street name audit, street names were found which are
in all caps or all lowercase. An updating function will be run over
the street names to properly capitalize them.

With the following query, a Mongo query was ran to visually inspect
all the street names and find any other problems:

\texttt{db.lexington\_orig.aggregate({[}\{\$group: \{ \_id: \textquotedbl{}\$address.street\textquotedbl{}\}\}{]})}

Some examples of inconsistent capitalization are: ``south Broadway,''
``meijer Way,'' and ``west Main Street.''


\subsection{Data entry problems with ZIP codes}

A Mongo query was ran to inspect the ZIP (postal) codes for this area.

\texttt{db.lexington\_orig.aggregate({[}\{\$match: \{\textquotedbl{}address\textquotedbl{}:\{\$exists:1\}\}\},
\{\$group: \{ \_id: \textquotedbl{}\$address.postcode\textquotedbl{},
count: \{\$sum: 1\}\}\}, \{\$sort: \{ count: 1\}\}{]})}

The results show that there is one ZIP code entered as ``KY'' (Kentucky,
the state) and 297 entries with no ZIP code (\texttt{null}). Adding
the ZIP codes is out of the scope of this project: it would require
checking the address against USPS or Google Maps API.

There are ZIP codes which include the extra four numbers. We will
ignore these and assume they are correct. Perhaps these could be split
into another field for better consistency and ease of querying.


\subsection{Data entry problems with street name}

One error was found with the street names where the house number was
included in \texttt{addr:street}, for ``524 Angliana Avenue.'' This
was fixed by removing ``524 `` from the street name and moving it
to \texttt{housenumber}.

judging by the number of bicycle parking places.

This result shows some naming inconsistencies, e.g. ``Republic Bank,''
``Republic,'' and ``Republic Bank \& Trust.''


\subsection{Determining a bicycle-friendly score of Lexington}

The data revealed there are a large number of bicycle parking facilities
in Lexington. This fact agrees with my intuition that college campus
cities have more bicyclists.

As a hypothetical person wanting to move to Lexington without a car,
I would want to know how bicycle-friendly this city is. I would want
ample access to bicycle parking, lanes, and repair stations.

The OpenStreetMap data includes information about bicycle parking,
including what type, e.g. stand, loops, rack, etc. It also includes
details about the bicycle repair stations, e.g. whether they have
a chain tool available or not. Unfortunately, I see a limited amount
of data about bicycle lanes on the streets, compared to the number
of ways.\\


\noindent \texttt{> db.lexington.find(\{\textquotedbl{}bicycle\textquotedbl{}:\textquotedbl{}yes\textquotedbl{}\}).count()}

\noindent \texttt{221}

\noindent \texttt{> db.lexington.find(\{\textquotedbl{}bicycle\textquotedbl{}:\textquotedbl{}no\textquotedbl{}\}).count()}

\noindent \texttt{119}

\noindent \texttt{> db.lexington.find(\{\textquotedbl{}bicycle\textquotedbl{}:\{\$exists:1\}\}).count()}

\noindent \texttt{341}

\noindent \texttt{> db.lexington.distinct(\textquotedbl{}bicycle\textquotedbl{})}

\noindent \texttt{{[} \textquotedbl{}no\textquotedbl{}, \textquotedbl{}yes\textquotedbl{},
\textquotedbl{}dismount\textquotedbl{} {]}}

\noindent \texttt{> db.lexington.aggregate({[}\{\$match: \{\textquotedbl{}type\textquotedbl{}:\textquotedbl{}way\textquotedbl{}\}\},
\{\$group: \{\_id: \textquotedbl{}\$name\textquotedbl{}, count: \{\$sum:1\}\}\},
\{\$sort: \{count: -1\}\}{]}).result.length}

\noindent \texttt{7908 \# 341/7908 = 4.3\%}\\


We could map out all bicycle-related places over Lexington, with special
icons for each, using OpenStreetMap or Google Maps API. This would
provide a useful visualization for the user.

A bicycle-friendly city score could be calculated by figuring the
number of bicycle parking or repair stations within each square mile
(density) of Lexington. The densities could be summed and normalized
to a 0-100 score. This score would only be calculable and useful when
the same process is done for other cities in America.

If this data was presented to the user in the form of a website or
mobile app as more than a proof-of-concept, we would have to consider
more carefully the correctness and completeness of the data. If Lexington
simply had much less bicycle-related data entered than actually exists
in the city, it would receive a poor bicycle-friendly city score,
undermining the usefulness of this recommendation. As a hypothetical
startup, we would have to hire bicycle and data experts to clean and
complete the data. They would have to take to the streets and document
carefully all bicycle-related points of interest in Lexington, and
all other major cities in the USA. This would be of great benefit
to OpenStreetMap, but because of the open license of the data, anyone
could then copy our efforts for free: not a sound business strategy.

The project's website could be presented as ``free tool'' or otherwise
a showcase of OpenStreetMap's data and power. The interface could
be opened up to allow for users to more easily enter their own bicycle-related
data into OpenStreetMap, gradually improving the accuracy of the bicycle-friendly
score. This approach is akin to Wikipedia, also known as crowdsourcing,
and relies on persons' honesty and inherent trust of one another for
the greater good of an accurate and useful tool for anyone to use,
free of charge.


\section{Conclusion}

The cleanliness of this dataset was no worse than expected. The usual
errors suggested by the Problem Set 6 were present, e.g. street type
abbreviations. Unsurprisingly, some place names were inconsistent,
and would require fixing by hand. There was a large number of ZIP
codes missing which can be fixed using a program tied with the USPS
address verification API. The user ``woodpeck\_fixbot'' was the
most active in this area, where the same user appeared as \#2 in the
sample project (Charlotte, NC)

The Lexington area OSM data is off to a good start, with details such
as whether a bicycle repair station has a chain repair tool, bicycle
lanes, and number of lanes. I would have to investigate further into
OSM to see what other types of data can be entered.
