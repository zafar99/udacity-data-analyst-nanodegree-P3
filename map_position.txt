Lexington is located in the heart of Kentucky, and is the second-largest city in Kentucky.
It is known as the "Horse Capital of the World" and is home to the University
of Kentucky.

I chose this city because it resides in my home state and its dataset was not
enormous, while still meeting the 50 MB minimum.
